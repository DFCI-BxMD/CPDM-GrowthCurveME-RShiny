## Introduction
In-vitro growth assays are often prone to multiple sources of variability, including well-to-well variation in seeding densities, variation across experimental replicates, and variation between equipment and facilities, all of which can significantly impact the reliability of growth estimates. These types of variability often stem from clustering, where data points within the same cluster, such as a well or experimental replicate, are more similar (or correlated) to each other than to data points in other clusters. Ignoring this clustering, as with traditional summary metrics or simple regression models, can lead to biased estimates and limit the reproducibility and generalizability of the results. The goal of GrowthCurveME is to address these aspects of variability by allowing users to easily fit linear and non-linear mixed-effects regression models to account for clustering (e.g., at the well-to-well level or experimental replicate level).

## Instructions

Download the R package version 0.1.0 of GrowthCurveME from CRAN https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GrowthCurveME.

## Follow these step-by-step instructions to effectively perform growth curve analysis:

### 1. Upload Your Dataset

Use the 'Upload Input Data' button to upload your dataset. The file must be in *.xlsx, *.csv, or *.txt format.
Ensure your input file contains at least the following columns: cluster, time, and growth_metric. 

### 2. Select Model Settings

- ```Model Function```: Choose the model to fit your data. Options include exponential, linear, logistic, and gompertz.
- ```Model Type```: Select mixed for mixed-effects models or least-squares for least-squares fitting.
- ```Fixed Rate```: Specify whether the rate is fixed (True) or not (False).
- ```Time Unit```: Enter the unit of time used in your dataset, such as hours or days.

### 3. Run Analysis
Click 'Run Analysis' to perform the analysis with the selected settings.

### 4. View Results
Navigate through the tabs to view the results:

- ```Summary Table of Model```: View a summary table generated by the growth_model_summary_table() function.
- ```Growth Plots```: Visualize scatter plots generated by the growth_vs_time() function.
- ```Residual Diagnostics```: Visualize scatter plots generated by the growth_model_residual_plots() function.
